        <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy pursuing a variety of hobbies that keep me active and engaged. Here are a few of my favorite activities:</p>
        <h2>Hiking and camping</h2>
        <p>I love spending time outdoors and exploring new hiking trails and campsites. There's nothing quite like the feeling of being surrounded by nature and disconnecting from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.</p>

        <h2>Reading Books</h2>
        <p> I'm an avid reader and enjoy getting lost in a good book. Whether it's a gripping thriller, a thought-provoking memoir, or a classic novel, I love the way that books can transport us to new worlds and perspectives</p>

        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>I enjoy capturing moments and memories through photography. Whether it's a beautiful landscape or a candid shot of friends and family, I love the way that photography can freeze a moment in time and tell a story.</p>

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
      
      <p>I find cooking to be both relaxing and rewarding. There's something satisfying about taking fresh ingredients and transforming them into a delicious meal to share with loved ones.</p>
